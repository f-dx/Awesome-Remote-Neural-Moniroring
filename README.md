# Awesome-Remote-Neural-Monitoring

## What is Remote Neural Monitoring?

DARPA-created technology (in collaboration with numerous partners and contractors) which is used for multiple purposes:

1. Remote monitoring and recognition of neural activity
2. Access to Broca's area (language center in the brain)
3. Illegal data sets generation using neural data collection
4. Neuro-modulation: low-level access to the majority of brain functions 
5. Body telemetry collection 24x7
6. Consciousness altering mechanisms
7. Synthetic modulated dreams and sleep patterns altering
8. Stunning (including coma-like states)
9. Kill switch mechanism (immediate death in 120-200ms)
10. Pain / Pleasure centers control and patterns modulation
11. Thoughts suppression, inner dialogue suppression
12. Thoughts injection / prompting
13. Audio, Visual, Tactile hallucinations
14. Muscle twitches and body movements control
15. Full vision channel and audio capture
16. Memories alteration and memories injection (work in progress)
17. Hormonal system control
18. Attention / Focus control
19. Social Patterns Modification
20. Visual cortex control
21. Realtime EEG-like data collection 24x7
22. Body hijacking for full remote control (if fully activated and deployed)
23. Simulation of full spectrum of neurological disorders
24. Remote body control and senses sharing
25. Full version has battle and tactical operations support (initial design)
26. Emergency cases assistance
27. Creation of brain network society (neural social network)

## Mechanism of action: possible explanation and reverse-engineering

Unfortunately, there is no common scientifically proven mechanism of action available in Targeted Individuals community.

However, here are top 10 hypotheses of how it can work:

1. Self-assembly (graphene-oxide based nano particles)
2. CRISPR-Cas9 DNA modification and combination of supportive mechanisms
3. Altered bio agents, parasites/bacterias/bacteriophages/single cell parasites (like Toxoplasma) and combination of them
4. Neuroprosthetics delivered using unknown mechanism of action
5. Micro implants (dental and other simple ways of delivery)
6. A combination of those
7. Other unknown mechanisms

## How to protect yourself?

- Avoid dental anaesthetics
- Avoid vaccines
- Avoid any Big Pharma injections
- Avoid food and bevereges from large holdings and corporations
- Isolate fully your head from RF while sleeping using conductive materials
- Limit GSM/LTE/5G/Wi-Fi/Bluetooth exposure (fully isolate yourself and monitor 24x7)
- Eat organic, non-processed food, drink only verified water, use water filters
- Use air filters at home to protect yourself from neural dust
- Use N95 mask in public places
- Regularly wash your hands
- Other unknown strategies

## How to deactivate? 

- RNM programming and control (easiest one when you are not a Targeted Individual)
- Isolation / Protection
- Immune system stimulation
- EMF fields
- RF fields
- Vibration
- Ultra Sound
- TENS electroestimulation
- Chemical / Pharmacology ways
- Physical activities
- Locate and disable in-wall emitters (using thermal cameras and RF scanners like HackRF)
- Mixed approaches
- Other unknown methods

## Activation mechanism

## 1. Rental properties and hotels

The Global Government is using black budgets and fake identities to buy properties near rental objects, which they then use as bases for local RNM operations. 
They basically have a presence in about 30-70% (a rough estimate) of hotels in Spain, for example. 
Platforms like Booking.com, Airbnb, and Idealista are used to redirect individuals to specific locations, which are totally controlled by local agents and equipped with RNM tuning equipment.

## 2. In-wall built-in devices in hotels and apartments (high density near roofs)

Local RNM (Remote Neural Monitoring) controllers, also known as hubs, are located near more than 60% of rental properties. They utilize a range of frequencies, including the 450-1250 MHz RF spectrum and the 2400-2500 MHz RF spectrum, as well as ultrasound and arrays of sound emitters for V2K (Voice to Skull) and psychological operations.

## How signal is delivered / communication channels

- Wi-FI (any wi-fi router), Bluetooth (any bluetooth device)
- Cellular Mobile Networks: GSM, 3G, LTE, 5G
- Satellites arrays (likely low orbit)
- Ultrasound
- Probably visual channel (optical nerve stimulation): via hidden patterns using LCD screens (iOS, Androoid, MacOS devices)
- Other unknown methods: area to explore further
