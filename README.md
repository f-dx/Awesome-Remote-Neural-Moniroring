# Awesome-Remote-Neural-Monitoring

## What is Remote Neural Monitoring?

DARPA-created technology (in collaboration with numerous partners and contractors) which is used for multiple purposes:

1. Monitoring and remote reading of thoughts
2. Control and filtering of thoughts
3. Neuro-modulation
4. Illegal data sets generation using neural data collection
5. Mind control and Mind programming
6. Synthetic dreams and sleep patterns altering
7. Stunning (including coma-like states)
8. **Kill switch mechanism (immediate death in 120-200ms)**
9. Pain / Pleasure centers control and patterns modulation
10. Thoughts suppression, inner dialogue suppression
11. Thoughts injection / prompting
12. Audio, Visual, Tactile hallucinations
13. Muscle twitches and body movements control
14. Full vision channel and audio capture
15. Memories alteration and memories injection (work in progress)
16. Hormonal system control
17. Attention / Focus control
18. Social Patterns Modification
19. Visual cortex control
20. Realtime EEG-like data collection 24x7
21. Body telemetry collection 24x7
22. Alter ego center creation, personality splitting
23. **Simulation of full spectrum of psychiatric disorders**
24. Remote body control and senses sharing
25. Full version has battle and tactical operations support (initial design)
26. Emergency cases assistance
27. Creation of brain network society (telepathic social network)

## Mechanism of action: possible explanation and reverse-engineering

Unfortunately, there is no common scientifically proven mechanism of action available in Targeted Individuals community.

However, here are top 10 hypotheses of how it can work:

1. Self-assembly (graphene-oxide based nano particles)
2. CRISPR-Cas9 DNA modification and combination of supportive mechanisms
3. Altered bio agents, parasites/bacterias/bacteriophages/single cell parasites (like Toxoplasma) and combination of them
4. Neuroprosthetics delivered using unknown mechanism of action
5. Micro implants (dental and other simple ways of delivery)
6. A combination of those
7. Other unknown mechanisms

## How to protect yourself?

- Avoid dental anaesthetics
- Avoid vaccines
- Avoid any Big Pharma injections
- Avoid food and bevereges from large holdings and corporations
- Isolate fully your head from RF while sleeping using conductive materials
- Limit GSM/LTE/5G/Wi-Fi/Bluetooth exposure (fully isolate yourself and monitor 24x7)
- Eat organic, non-processed food, drink only verified water, use water filters
- Use air filters at home to protect yourself from neural dust
- Use N95 mask in public places
- Regularly wash your hands
- Other unknown strategies

## How to deactivate? 

- RNM programming and control (easiest one when you are not a Targeted Individual)
- Isolation / Protection
- EMF fields
- RF fields
- Vibration
- Ultra Sound
- TENS electroestimulation
- Chemical / Pharmacology ways
- Physical activities
- **Immune system stimulation**
- Locate and disable in-wall emitters (using thermal cameras and RF scanners like HackRF)
- Mixed approaches
- Other unknown methods

## Activation mechanism

## 1. Rental properties and hotels

The Global Government is using black budgets and fake identities to buy properties near rental objects (and rental objects), which they then use as bases for local RNM operations. 
They basically have a presence in about 30-70% (a rough estimate) of hotels in Spain, for example. 
Platforms like Booking.com, Airbnb, and Idealista are used to redirect individuals to specific locations, which are totally controlled by local agents and equipped with RNM tuning equipment.

## 2. In-wall built-in devices in hotels and apartments (high density near roofs)

Local RNM (Remote Neural Monitoring) controllers, also known as hubs, are located near more than 60% of rental properties. They utilize a range of frequencies, including the 450-1250 MHz RF spectrum and the 2400-2500 MHz RF spectrum, as well as ultrasound and arrays of sound emitters for V2K (Voice to Skull) and psychological operations.

## How signal is delivered / communication channels

- Wi-FI (any wi-fi router), Bluetooth (any bluetooth device)
- Cellular Mobile Networks: GSM, 3G, LTE, 5G
- Satellites arrays (likely low orbit)
- Ultrasound
- Probably visual channel (optical nerve stimulation): via hidden patterns using LCD screens (iOS, Androoid, MacOS devices)
- Other unknown methods: area to explore further
