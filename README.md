# Awesome-Remote-Neural-Monitoring

What is Remote Neural Monitoring?

DARPA-created technology (in collaboration with numerous partners and contractors) which is used for multiple purposes:

1. Creation of brain network society (telepathic social network)
2. Control and monitoring of thoughts
3. Neuro-modulation
4. Illegal data sets generation using neural data collection
5. Mind control and Mind programming
6. Synthetic dreams and sleep patterns altering
7. Stunning (including coma-like states)
8. **Kill switch mechanism (immediate death in 120-200ms)**
9. Pain / Pleasure centers control and patterns modulation
10. Thoughts suppression, inner dialogue suppression
11. Thoughts injection / prompting
12. Audio, Visual, Tactile hallucinations
13. Muscle twitches and body movements control
14. Full vision channel and audio capture
15. Memories alteration and memories injection (work in progress)
16. Hormonal system control
17. Attention / Focus control
18. Social Patterns Modification
19. Visual cortex control
20. Realtime EEG-like data collection 24x7
21. Body telemetry collection 24x7
22. Alter ego center creation, personality splitting
23. **Simulation of full spectrum of psychiatric disorders**
24. Remote body control and senses sharing
25. Full version has battle and tactical operations support (initial design)
26. Emergency cases assistance
